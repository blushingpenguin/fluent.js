# Changelog

## @fluent/dedent 0.1.0 (May 23, 2019)

This is the first release of `@fluent/dedent` as an independent package. It's
based on the `ftl` template tag from the `fluent` package, but the behavior
has changed and the code has been refactored.

The behavior in this version is largely based on the [multiline strings
specification in Swift][1]. See the `README.md` for more details.
